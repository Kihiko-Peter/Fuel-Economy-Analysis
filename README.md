# Fuel-Economy-Analysis
## Understanding the Context
The test data used to determine fuel economy estimates is derived from vehicle testing done at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and by vehicle manufacturers who submit their own test data to EPA.

Each year, EPA provides fuel economy data to the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) so that they can administer their fuel economy-related programs
